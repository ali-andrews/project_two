####What is Vanguard? 

Vanguard is the first news organisation that doesnâ€™t follow an agenda. Vanguard quickly realised that News organisations all have their own agendas. Thus, Vanguard was born- with one basic philosophy of being able to provide an un-biased news to all- uploaded by any individual. From sharing local news stories to some of the biggest events in history- users report what they feel. <br>

To get an unbiased view, you need to have information from multiple sources- in Vanguards case yourself and other everyday individuals. Society can upload their own news, photographs and thoughts. Vanguard correlates a users understanding of society with news.

###Chosen Materials

###Creation Process 
Here are some 'mock up boards' which I thought I based my initial thought process around as I liked thier layouts.

###Improvements
With more time I would have implemented an 'Edit User Information Page' which would allow users to update their details i.e. employment what company they have worked for. Some extra information about them so that other users could know a bit about them or hire potential users if they like their pieces etc.

Implement further effects and animations
<br> 

Upload a 'gem' that would allow me to upload multiple photos rather than just one. 
<br> 

Would have more social plugins like a 'share' link in order to drive more traffic to my site. 
<br>

Aswell as a comment gem which would enable people to chat and debate articles amongst one another.As this helps gain more exposure.
