###VANGUARD
####What is Vanguard? 

Vanguard is the first news organisation that doesnâ€™t follow an agenda. Vanguard quickly realised that News organisations all have their own agendas. Thus, Vanguard was born- with one basic philosophy of being able to provide un-biased news to all- uploaded by any individual how they see and feel it. From sharing local news stories to some of the biggest events in history- users report what they feel. <br>

To get an unbiased view, you need to have information from multiple sources- in Vanguards case yourself and other everyday individuals. Society can upload their own news, photographs and thoughts. Vanguard correlates a users understanding of society with news. 
<br>

Vanguard is a News organisation with all articles and photographs taken by you're everyday person with what they see and feel. <br>

###Creation Process 
Here are some 'mock up boards' which I thought I would base my thought process around as I liked thier layouts. 


Two different ideas for the front cover:

###Chosen Materials:

The images used for Vanguard, are not all mine nor do I claim any involvement in their creation. The materials are used under Fair Use for academic and educational purpose, and should not be redistributed otherwise without permission from their creators. 


###Responsive Design
Pending improvment: need to build it to be responsive - over all devices.

###Additional Extras
The font color I based my design around was: #ADD8E6
<br>
Font Used: Lato (Google fonts)


###Improvements
With more time I would have implemented an 'Edit User Information Page' which would allow users to update their details i.e. employment what company they have worked for. Some extra information about them so that other users could know a bit about them or hire potential users if they like their pieces etc.
<br> 
Would implement further effects and animations
